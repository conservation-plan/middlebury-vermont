## Goals

* Conserve and provide stewardship of existing relatively large patches of contiguous forest habitat (>250 acres) within town or overlapping with other towns.     
* Discourage subdivision and parcelization of that habitat.  
* Ensure the viability of working lands associated with a sustainable forest products economy due to their significant contribution to this and other fish, wildlife, and natural heritage elements.
