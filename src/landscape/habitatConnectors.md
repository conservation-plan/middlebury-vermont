## Goals   

* Ensure that animals and plants are able to move freely between conserved lands and lands under long-term
stewardship, contiguous forest habitat, and other important habitats, land features and natural communities to meet all their requirements for survival by increasing the acreage of connecting lands.  
* Ensure that wildlife can move long distances — beyond the boundaries of the town or area of interest — as they need to for breeding, dispersal, and adaptation to climate or habitat change.
