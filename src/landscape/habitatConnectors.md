To promote a [*functional rural*](rural.md) landscape.

*insert a diagram to illustrate problem (left) and solution (right)*

## Problem  

Human land use has fragmented the landscape into relatively small, separate patches of good habitat. Fragmentation impedes the ability of native species to move between patches, diminishing carrying capacity, diversity, and resilience to climate change.  

## Goals   

- Ensure that animals and plants are able to move freely between conserved lands and lands under long-term stewardship, contiguous forest habitat, and other important habitats, land features and natural communities to meet all their requirements for survival by increasing the acreage of connecting lands.  

- Ensure that wildlife can move long distances — beyond the boundaries of the town or area of interest — as they need to for breeding, dispersal, and adaptation to climate or habitat change.  

## Plan

*Map layers that compare current versus recommended geography*

## Related goals  

- Promote and support incentives for landowners to restore native species in agricultural lands adjacent to forest blocks and within flood zones that promote [*swamp forest*](../community/swamps.md), [*floodplain forest*](../community/floodplainForests.md), and [*valley clayplain forest*](../community/clayplainForests.md) natural communities.  

- Promote and support incentives for landowners to integrate [*native gardens*](../community/nativeGardens.md) into landscaping on developed lands.
