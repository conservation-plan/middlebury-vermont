The purposes of a conservation plan are to:  

1. document clear definitions, goals, and locations of conservation elements in Middlebury to strengthen the role of Town Plan in Act 250 and PUC reviews;

2. identify criteria to prioritize the allocation of resources for land conservation and stewardship, including applications of Town Conservation Fund;

3. provide guidance to land owners on incentives and opportunities for pursuing conservation easements on parcels or portions of private lands;  

4. identify preferred areas of development and connect environmental impact assessments at specific sites to town-wide and landscape-level conservation goals;  

5. foster communication and engagement across town commissions and committees, staff, stakeholders, and general public about town conservation goals and resources.
