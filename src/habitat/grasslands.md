## Goals

* Where appropriate, encourage management of existing grasslands larger than five acres, including artificial habitats, in a manner compatible with successful grassland bird nesting.  
* Identify and maintain or increase populations of rare/uncommon grassland birds in the town or area of interest.  

### Early-Successional Forest and Shrub Habitat  

* Maintain early-successional forest and shrub habitat and, where appropriate, increase the acreage of this habitat within the town or area of interest.  
* Encourage management of existing early-successional forest and shrub habitat in a manner compatible
with the nesting, breeding, and broodrearing requirements of the American woodcock. This species may serve as a useful surrogate for the habitat requirements of other early-successional habitat dependant wildlife.
