## Goals

* Ensure that conserved lands or lands under long-term stewardship cover the full range of elevations in the town.  
* Ensure that conserved land, or land under long-term stewardship, in the town cover all the town’s bedrock types and soil types, especially those types that are unusual in the state.  
* Ensure that conserved lands or lands under long-term stewardship encompass a diversity of landforms.  
* Seek to conserve the complementary landscapes identified by the Vermont Biodiversity Project (see Vermont’s Natural Heritage). Sometimes this will require cooperation with neighboring towns.
