## Goals  

* Ensure the conservation and proper stewardship of significant natural communities found within the town or area
of interest.  
* Restore degraded but potentially significant natural communities to a viable condition in places where the land is suitable.  
* Ensure that large-scale natural communities are conserved or are under longterm stewardship in blocks that are large enough (e.g., thousands of acres) to function ecologically with as great a breadth as possible. This may require multi-town efforts.
