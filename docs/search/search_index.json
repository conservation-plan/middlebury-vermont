As a result, these urban and suburban places act as ecological sinks, barriers, and native deserts. Goals Promote the use of native plant species in places that are already developed to improve habitat for native insects, birds, and animals. Encourage private landowners and neighborhoods to transform portions of lawns and fields into gardens and hedgerows of native species. Plan To my knowledge, we don\u2019t have data on who gardens with native plants in Middlebury. This section should identify this gap, identify potential collaborators (Town Tree Committee, Audubon, etc.), and make recommendations to engage citizens through participatory map projects and potential student independent projects. Completing patterns Promote keystone species of native trees and shrubs. Promote urban and suburban landscaping plans with a minimum of 70% native biomass provided by ecologically productive plant species. Minimize artificial light and promote dark skies .
