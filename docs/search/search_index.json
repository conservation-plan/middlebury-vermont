Ensure the stewardship of existing contiguous forest habitat and avoid subdivision and parcelization of that habitat. Block shape Conserve habitat blocks with large core habitats that are not influenced by edge effects. Promote the expansion of native woody species on the edges of forest blocks with large perimeter to area ratios, particularly forest blocks with rare or under-represented natural communities. Natural communities Ensure the conservation and proper stewardship of significant natural communities. Restore degraded but potentially significant natural communities to a viable condition in places where the land is suitable. Ensure that conserved lands or lands under long-term stewardship are representative of the full range of natural communities found in Middlebury and are of sufficient size for ecological functions of these natural communities. Canopy age Protect old stands of forest from clear-cuts, housing development, and other large-scale land cover conversions. Maintain early-successional forest habitat and, where appropriate, increase the acreage of this habitat. Wildlife habitat Maintain and protect the functional integrity of all deer wintering areas. Increase the number of acres of deer winter habitat that is under longterm stewardship or that is permanently conserved. Maintain and protect the functional integrity of all mast stands. Increase the number of acres of mast stand habitat that is under long-term stewardship or conserved. Protect and promote foraging habitat for woodland bat species. Climate refugia Protect valley forest blocks with geographic features that foster cooler micro-climates to promote refugia from climate change.","title":"Forest blocks"},{"location":"forests/#contiguous-blocks","text":"Conserve large patches of contiguous forest habitat.
